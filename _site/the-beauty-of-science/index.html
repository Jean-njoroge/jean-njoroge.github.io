  <div class="entry">
    <p>I draw inspiration from creativity in science, and the ability to take and manipulate the science to benefit society.

<p>However, even though I am an engineer by training, some days, I feel like I am more of a scientist than an engineer, other days, I am a math whiz, coz I am fascinated by numbers. That which can amount to an absolute and even show a trend, that could predict what your shopping habits could be in the future, or used to preserve a product such that you can consume it at later date.
However, careewise I settled to being an Engineer, because I figured one can combined the science(exploring), engineering (application) and math (analysis) to invent, innovate and analysis to solve daunting problems.<br />
You see, education, has always come easy to me, there is not a subject that I never excelled, whether it was history or physical education. I grasp things quick, I work quickly, and then I need to move to the next challenging thing. In essence, I need to be high on challenge. I am inhrently a problem-solver.</p>
